	<!-- About me  -->
	<article> 
		<p> 
			A growing passionate User Experience & Interface Designer at Rochester Institute of Technology. Passionate about applying human-centered design,  accessibility and inclusivity in varying technologies. <br>

			User Experience Design touches a lot of my personal qualities of my need to understand and connecting with others. The beauty of UX is trying to understanding different groupsâ€™ soft and pain points through the ambiguity. <br>

			Aside my professional interest, I am found to be flexing the lobes of my brain through rock climbing, table tennis, and obsessively reading personality psychology. Recently, I have taken an interest to the realm of fashion design and positive psychology.
