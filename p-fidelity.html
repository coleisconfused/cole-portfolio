			<h3>The Problem Statement</h3>
			<p>Our current resource on Fidelity.com has the tools for money management, but does not communicate the knowledge needed to make financial decisions for now and the future. This makes it difficult for users to understand their finances and hinders their general awareness to financial opportunities. This summer, ideate(?) a solution to make money management on Fidelity.com more inclusive for all users.</p>

			<div class="researching">
				<h5>Researching to Learn</h5>
				<h6>Diving face first into the academic journals and articles.</h6>

				<p>When I was assigned this project, I did not know much about financial wellness nor (embarrassingly) finance. Thus, instinctively my initial approach was to snoop around different sources of academic journals and as well as other financial company resources. To answer some of the questions that lingering in my head:</p>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-items">
				<div class="f-1"> 
					<p>Prudential reports 60% of employees mark financial stress as their one of their top stressors above issues related to jobs, relationships, and health.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="f-2"> 
					<p>PWC reports 42% of the people in the survey take out money from their retirement fund to pay off other expenses.!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="f-3"> 
					<p>PWC reports 42% of the people in the survey take out money from their retirement fund to pay off other expenses.!</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="researching">
				<h5>Learning from the Interviews</h5>
				<h6>For me it’s easier for me to process the situation by talking to others who are going through the experience.</h6>

				<p>I wanted to learn more about their thoughts on their current financial habits. I focused primarily on finding out more about on what they are doing to handling their financials to attain wellness.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-items">
				<div class="f-1"> 
					<p class="small-titles">What does financial wellness mean for you?</p>
					<p>The interviewees did not struggle explaining what it meant nor the steps to becoming financially well. Rather, there was a trend in lack of action.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="f-2"> 
					<p class="small-titles">Have you used an application to manage your finances?</p>
					<p>Majority has tried an application like Clarity Money, Mint, Excel and Acorns. However, these fin-techs were quickly dropped due to the labor of setting-up and just completing forgetting about it.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="f-3"> 
					<p class="small-titles">Have you thought about investing in stocks?</p>
					<p>Only a few actually invest in stocks while some others have thought about attempting but never took the initiative to invest. From the responses, it seems that they are intimidated or confused to fully commit despite the abundance of information online. For instance, they want to understand what are the thought processes that goes into investing. Some of them never had the “financial talk” with the family, so the thought of stocks never crossed their mind.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="researching">
				<h5>Understanding the other fin-techs</h5>
				<h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>

				<p>I wanted to learn more about others thoughts on their current financial stance. I focused primarily on finding out more about on what they are doing currently to combat with financial wellness.</p>

				<h5>Researching Fidelity’s current screens</h5>
				<h6>This represents what Fidelity has and what they are working with.</h6>
			</div>

			<img class="banner" width="100%" height="600px"  src="images/projects/fidelity-images/outlined-screens.png" alt="Banner">

			<div class="grid-items">
				<div class="f-1"> 
					<p class="small-titles">First Screen</p>
					<p>Activity and pressing history shows the user where and when their money is being spent on.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="f-2"> 
					<p class="small-titles">Second Screen</p>
					<p>: The summary shows the user’s balance details, which includes the user’s investments and cash balance. So if the user’s investment goes up in price by 30 cents, the balance will increase to $195.09.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="f-3"> 
					<p class="small-titles">Third Screen</p>
					<p>In the same summary panel, if the user scrolls down they will reach a section called Performance Benchmarks. This part shows the user… to be quite honest, I do not know myself. The first row is related to the amount of return from the user’s investments, but the rest is unclear to me.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="researching">
				<h5>My thoughts after the research</h5>
				<p>The phrase cash-management seemed to be a bit contradicting to what the page is for. The cash management was designed primarily for individuals who are already knowledgeable to this sort of thing. The individuals who are not as knowledgeable struggle with partaking in the investing and cash management realm.</p>

				<h4> The Project Goals </h4>
				<h6> This project will focus on these three areas: call to action, financial literacy and financial management. </h6>
				
				<div class="grid-items">
					<div class="f-1"> 
						<p class="small-titles">Financial management</p>
						<p>Users would be able to track down and visually see the flow of their money.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="f-2"> 
						<p class="small-titles">Calling to action</p>
						<p>Not only showing the user where their money is traveling but provide an action for them to start investing with it.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="f-3"> 
						<p class="small-titles">Financial literacy</p>
						<p>Simplifying the language would make the approach to management easier.</p>

			<div class="Goals">
				<h4>The Project Solution</h4>
				<p> I wanted to create an inclusive concept that will advocate excluded individuals to start investing with small amounts of money. These smaller actions of investments will likely get these individuals comfortable and understand how to approach investments. In addition, the concept will also include traditional FinTech graphs to allow the individuals to see their money flow.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="goals">
				<h6>For Healthier Spending Habits</h6>
				<p>Users will be able to compare and view their spending habits throughout the month. The user will be able to select a button that will allow them to start investing.</p>
				<div class="placeholder"></div>
			</div>

			<div class="goals">
				<h6>For a Healthy Financial Future </h6>
				<p>Individuals will have the opportunity to select a button to locate them to a page that will automate the process of distributing their deposit of money into three categories of needs, wants and savings.</p>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<h6>I wanted to make this concept to be inclusive to allow the excluded to participate in investing in their own future with Fidelity Investments.</h6>
				<p>Engaging myself with in-depth user interviews and qualitative analysis tremendously helped with creating an concept that caters to the user’s needs. Especially when the concept is not exactly working and gives lead way to pivot the concept.  This project not only shown me the capability of qualitative analysis but seeking out mentor-ship and feedback when you are the only intern on the team. Being the only intern taught me a lot about my organization skills and about how to seek out others for feedback.</p>
